# What to do with the access_token and how to fix your Discord auth errors

---

## 1. **What to do with the access_token**

- The access token you got from your curl command:
  ```
  {"access_token":"MTM5Mzk5MzgwMDk4ODQ5MTc3Ng.DUS08I8auQXZE5vexpMBTS1M9JISts"}
  ```
- **You do NOT paste this into your app.**
- This is for debugging only. In production, your app gets this token automatically after the Discord OAuth2 flow.

---

## 2. **Why you see `SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input`**

- This error means your frontend is trying to parse a response as JSON, but the response is empty or not valid JSON.
- This usually happens if:
  - The backend `/api/token` route returns an empty response, HTML, or a non-JSON error.
  - The frontend is not sending the correct POST request, or the backend is not reachable from the frontend.
  - The frontend is not using the correct endpoint (should be `/.proxy/api/token` inside Discord Activity).

---

## 3. **How to fix**

### **A. Ensure your frontend is using the correct endpoint**

- In Discord Activity, the frontend must POST to:
  ```
  /.proxy/api/token
  ```
- In your code, you have:
  ```js
  let tokenUrl = "/.proxy/api/token";
  ```
  This is correct.

### **B. Ensure your backend always returns JSON**

- Your backend logs show it is returning JSON for POST `/api/token`.
- If you ever see this error, check your backend logs for errors or 500s.

### **C. Check for 404s and missing resources**

- The error `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()` means your frontend is requesting a file that does not exist (often a font or image).
- Check your browser's Network tab for which file is missing and either add it or remove the reference.

### **D. Check for CORS or proxy issues**

- If your frontend is deployed as a static site and your backend as a web service, make sure the frontend uses the `.proxy` path for API calls in Discord Activity.
- For local dev, use the local backend URL.

## 4. **Summary Table**

| Problem/Error | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'` | Backend returned empty/HTML/non-JSON | Ensure backend always returns JSON, check logs |
| 404 resource  | Missing file (font/image) | Add file or remove reference in code/CSS |
| 404 on `/api/token` (GET) | Only POST is supported | Use POST, not GET |
| 500 on `/api/token` | Invalid/expired code | Use a fresh code from Discord OAuth2 flow |

---

## 5. **Next Steps**

- **You do NOT use the access_token manually in your app.**
- If you see the error above, check your backend logs for the corresponding request and error.
- Make sure your frontend is sending the POST to the correct endpoint and that your backend always returns JSON.
- Fix any missing static resources (fonts/images) in your frontend.
